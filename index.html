        <h1>Sports and Interests</h1>
        <p class = "about">
            In elementary school, I tried a bunch of sports before I eventually decided to commit swimming
            ,which ended up being my main interest and past time for the next ~10 years. During my swimming career
            my biggest achievements include, being able to compete at a national level with people all along the East coast
            and achieving state titles, both in club and high school settings. 
            <br><br>
            Other than school, work, practices, and spending time with friends. I am also interested in video games and computers. With
            the help of one of my friends I even built my own computer from scratch.
            <br><br>
            Since comming to college, I decided to retire from swimming competitvely and decided to start competeting in a new sport
            Ultimate Frisbee.
